# rayex-examples

This repository contains a collection of example scenes to show how [rayex](https://github.com/chillpert/rayex) can be used in an actual project. It shows almost all features the framework has to offer currently.

## Usage

**Note:** The instructions below currently only work on Linux out of the box. Proper Windows support will follow shortly.  

1. Clone and compile [rayex](https://github.com/chillpert/rayex) or grab pre-built binaries for your system.
2. Clone this repostiory so that it is located in the same directory as the rayex repository (otherwise you would have to modify the CMakeLists.txt to match rayex's location)
3. Compile the examples

## Documentation

A documentation of all classes and functions can be found [here](https://chillpert.github.io/rayex/html/index.html).
